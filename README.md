# Express.js Crash Course
My notes on the express.js framework. Heavily commented for me to understand each thing that's going on. I have made this repository in case I need a shareable future reference or if the original files get deleted.

# Disclaimer
The folder named "modes" is supposed to be named "models", however I am too lazy to fix it. 

# NPM packages installed:
- nodemon
- dotenv
- mongoose
- express
- cors
- body-parser
